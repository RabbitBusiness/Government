How to Submit a Proposal
Steps
Start a new topic in Proposal in https://github.com/universalweb/Government/discussions. It can be a solid plan or just an idea.
Discuss with the community in Forum for at least 24 hours before voting
Write a proposal to conclude the whole idea
Proposal MUST have a proper title to reveal the core idea
Proposal MUST begin with Summary section (in short, please)
Proposal MUST have Action Item section for explaining each voting option explicitly
Proposal SHOULD use “For” / “Against” as options in binary decision
Proposal SHOULD provide “No Change Required” as option in multiple choice
Proposal CAN have Background, Motivation, Specification or any other aspect to support the idea, or use https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md
Submit the proposal along with topic link in Snapshot by holding 100,000 SNTVT at least, which is also the minimum requirement for a proposal to list in Snapshot, and the voting period must be longer than 72 hours
Comment in the topic with the voting link

Voting Power
Your voting power = average of (A + B)

A: SNTVT in the wallet
B: SNTVT from your SNTVT-DAI (VLP) token in the wallet



Note: four-weeks average is calculated by the balance at these 5 particular timings (equally weighted):

At the block number designated by the Snapshot voting
7 days prior to the block number
14 days prior to the block number
21 days prior to the block number
28 days prior to the block number
Warning
If a proposal does not follow these steps, it is invalid
If a proposal does not get more than 250,000,000 SNTVT votes in total, it is invalid
All rules can be modified by a valid proposal, but “fully discussed with the community” should be the principle
All rules apply to the community and the team
