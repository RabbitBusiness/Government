		description: `This is a proposal to end the current USDC and wBTC pools effective immediately. Release the locked rewards over a 10 day period. We redistribute the leftover rewards to the DAI pool that will run until 28/2/2021. <br />
This will keep holders happy until wVIAT swap end offset potential dumping of the rewards from the other pools, as they can re-stake it in the DAI for a raised APY. Also encourages potential new investors to buy, as they can stake immediately all of their SNTVT until wVIAT is ready.`,
